**ChoreOps helps keep your home running smoothly... _Level Up your Household Tasks_**

Whether you are staying on top of a busy lifestyle, sharing duties with a housemate, or trying to motivate your kids, ChoreOps fills a critical gap in the ecosystem. Users needed something more powerful than a simple to-do list, but more integrated and private than external cloud services.

Born from the popular _KidsChores_ integration, ChoreOps evolves that foundation into a sophisticated **Household Operations Platform**. It recognizes that while the high-quality gamification at its core is a powerful motivator for many, others just want the trash taken out on time.

## Run It Your Way

**Whether you need a full XP/Reward economy for the kids, or a silent "Operations Center" for housemates, ChoreOps adapts to you.**

### 🎮 The Gamified Home

Lean into the native **XP, Badges, Achievements, and Streaks**. Turn household participation into an engaging loop that motivates everyone to chase high scores and earn rewards.

### ⚙️ The Utility Home

Strip away the game layer entirely. Use the **Enterprise-Grade Scheduling** and **Rotation Logic** to automate the mental load of household maintenance. Get actionable notifications for the trash, filters, and bills—without a single point or badge involved.

### ⚖️ The Hybrid Home

**The best of both worlds.** Configure some profiles with full gamification to drive engagement, while keeping other profiles strictly utilitarian.
